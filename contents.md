Software quality for PyTango Device Servers
===========================================

## Unit-testing, documentation and packaging

Vincent Michel - MAX IV - NEXEYA

TANGO Meeting 2015 - Krakow

[bit.do/pytango-quality](http://bit.do/pytango-quality)

???

Software quality for Python applied to TANGO DS

Unittesting with unittest and nose

Documentation with sphinx

Packaging with setuptools

1. Unit testing
===============

---
name: title 1
class: center, middle

**F**ast

**A**utomated

**I**solated

**R**epeatable

???

Fast: Unit tests should run fast and be run often

Automated: Unit tests should run fast and be run often

Isolated: Unit tests test small things

Repeatable: requires an independant and isolated environment

***
---
name: unit testing - problems

## Problems

- How to deal with the TANGO database?

  - Use --file option

???

run a local database from a file

***
--

- How to simulate hardware communication?

  - Mocking (python-mock)

???

Mocking external dependencies is what makes unit tests isolated

***
--

- How to simulate the client?

  - PyTango.DeviceProxy

???

That was an easy one

***
--

- How to handle both at the same time?

  - Threaded environment

???

Testing while running the device server in a separate thread

Makes it accessible
- from the inside (mocking and monkey patching)
- from the outside (device proxy)

=> accessing the device from both ends

***
---
name: unit testing - devicetest

## devicetest python library


- On github:

  - [vxgmichel/python-tango-devicetest](http://github.com/vxgmichel/python-tango-devicetest)

  - includes a detailed README and a demo project

???

Feel free to fork it !

***
--

- Provides:

  - a context manager

  - a command line interface

  - a test case base class

???

Requirement: PyTango >= 8.1.1

Uses unittest module

***
---
name: unit-testing - example 1

## Example - PyTango device

```python
class Motor(Device):
    __metaclass__ = DeviceMeta

    host = device_property(dtype=str)

    def init_device(self):
        self.get_device_properties()
        self.controller = MotorController(self.host + ":1234") 
    
    position = attribute(dtype=float, access=AttrWriteType.READ_WRITE)

    def read_position(self):
        radian = self.controller.read()
        return math.degrees(radian)

    def write_position(self, value):
        radian = math.radians(value)
        self.controller.write(radian)
```

???

Simple device:

 - a host property used to initialize a motor controller (host + port)

 - a position attribute in degree

 - but the motor controller works with radians

 - convert angles using math.degree and math.radians

***
---
name: unit testing - example 2

## Example - Context manager and CLI

```python
>>> from devicetest import TangoTestContext
>>> from motor import Motor
>>> prop = {"host":"10.10.10.10"}
>>> with TangoTestContext(Motor, properties=prop) as proxy:
...     print proxy.position
```

Run the device `motor.Motor` locally
 - optional properties, port and debug level
 - compatible with old and new API

???

Context manager rocks!

Enter: start the server

Exit: kill the server 

Simple!

***
--

```bash
usr@machine:/~python-devicetest$ python -m devicetest motor.Motor
--prop "{'host':'10.10.10.10'}"
Ready to accept request
Motor started on port 55683 with properties {'host': '10.10.10.10'}.
Device access: localhost:55683/test/nodb/motor#dbase=no
Server access: localhost:55683/dserver/Motor/motor#dbase=no
```

???

CLI equivalent, displaying accesses for clients

***
---
name: unit testing - example 3

## Example - Test case

```python
class MotorTestCase(DeviceTestCase):

    device = motor.Motor
    properties = {'host': '10.10.10.10'}

    @classmethod
    def mocking(cls):
        cls.controller_cls = motor.MotorController = Mock()
        cls.controller = motor.MotorController.return_value
    
    def test_properties(self):
*       self.controller_cls.assert_called_with('10.10.10.10:1234')
        
    def test_position(self):
        for deg, rad in [(0, 0), (-90, -pi/2), (90, pi/2)]:
            self.device.position = deg
*           self.controller.write.assert_called_with(rad)
            self.controller.read.return_value = rad
*           self.assertEquals(self.device.position, deg)
```

???

Test case is set up using class attributes

2 tests, 3 assertions (highlighted)

Mocking: class method called before every tests

1 - Check proper controller instanciation

For three different angles:

2 - Check proper writing of attribute position

3 - Check proper reading of attribute position

The Init command is run between each tests

---
name: unit testing - example 4

## Example - Running the tests

Using nose:

```bash
$ nosetests test_motor --processes=1 --process-restartworker --verbose
```

???

nose: a test collector

processes=1: enable multiprocessing 

restartworker: use a different process for each test module

verbose: get a verbose output

***
--

Tests output:

```bash
test_position (test_motor.MotorTestCase) ... ok
test_properties (test_motor.MotorTestCase) ... ok

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 2 tests in 0.043s

OK
```

???

Hourray, it passes!

And fast, 43 ms!

Can be easily automated

***
--

Tests could also include:

- commands, state machine, etc.

???

Obvisously, this was a simple device

But it works fine with more complex devices (scope device)

***
---
name: unit testing - results

### Results

 - Tests are independant as long as the `Init` command clears the device state

 - Works for devices using an internal thread

 - Quite fast: less than 100ms for simple test cases

???

This should usually be the case (except for ALBA devices)

Requires more precaution, but works fine (scope device)

Up to a few seconds for big devices with inner thread

***
--

### Limitations

 - Using a test context twice will produce a segmentation fault

 - Properties cannot be changed between each test

 - Tango events are not supported by the '--file' execution mode

 - Not compatible with the coverage tool "coverage"

???

Known issue in PyTango, might be possible to use RestartServer once it is fixed

Probably the biggest issue, even though it is possible to use several test modules

Another big issue, see the documentation for more details, though it can be mocked 

Coverage is great, but somehow, the tango layer messes up with its collector

***

2. Documentation
===============

---
name: title 2
class: center, middle

Generating documentation from the code 

Sphinx extensions

???

Pogo can do it to, sure.

But still, sphinx has many interesting features.

---
name: documentation - sphinx presentation

### autodoc extension

 - build an html documentation from python docstrings

 - using directives in reStructuredText source files

???

Probably the most important extension of sphinx

Structure the documentation with rst files

But fetch the contents directly from the code

***
--

### devicedoc extension

 - Available on github

   - [vxgmichel/python-tango-devicedoc](http://github.com/vxgmichel/python-tango-devicedoc)

 - Includes:

  - A detailed README

  - A demo project

???

That extension recognizes TANGO object and adapt to generate the documentation

Again feel free to play with it!

***
---
name: documentation - example 1

## Example - PyTango Device

Documented motor device:

```python
class Motor(Device):
    """Motor device.

    Device states description:
*       - **ON**: the device is up and running
*       - **FAULT**: cannot connect to the controller
    """
    __metaclass__ = DeviceMeta

*   #: Can also be an IP address
    host = device_property(
        dtype=str,
        doc="Hostname of the motor.")

    [...]
```

???

First note: `rst` syntaxes inside docstrings

Second note: "hash + column" notation to add documentation to python attributes

***
---
name: documentation - example 2

## Example - PyTango Device

Adding a command:

```python
    [...]

    position = attribute(
        dtype=float,
*       unit="degrees",
        access=AttrWriteType.READ_WRITE,
        doc="Current position of the motor.")

    @command(
*       dtype_in=float, doc_in="angle in degrees",
*       dtype_out=float, doc_out="angle in radians")
    def radians(self, arg):
        """Convert the given angle from degrees to radians."""
        return math.radians(arg)

    [...]
```

???

Adding the unit to the position attribute arguments

Adding a command that converts a float to a float

***
---
name: documentation - example 3

## Example - Sphinx configuration

Configuration file: `conf.py`

```python
master_doc = 'index'
project = 'tango-device-motor'
copyright = '2015, Tango Controls'
extensions = ['sphinx.ext.autodoc', 'devicedoc']
```

???

Minimal configuration file

Includes metadata and settings

***
--

Source file: `index.rst`

```bash
.. automodule:: motor
    :members: Motor
```

???

Minimal `rst` file.

Using the `automodule` directive to generate the documentation for `motor.Motor`

***
--

Build documentation

```bash
sphinx-build docs/source docs/builds
```

???

A simple command to build the doc

source to destination

***
---
name: documentation view
template: empty layout
background-image: url(documentation.png)

???

So that's what we get.

Check all the docstrings out.

***
---
name: documentation - results

### Features

- More sphinx directive for customized documentation

- Possibility to automate builds (git hook, jenkins, etc.)

???

Again, the scope project is a good example of that

Or uploading on github pages

***
--

### Limitations

- Not compatible with the old PyTango API

- Experimental, some syntaxes won't work as expected

- Rigid implementation of headers and sections

???

And it's probably not gonna change

Yep, sorry about that!

Again, feel free to work on it!

***

name: packaging layout
layout: true

3. Packaging
============

---
name: title 2
class: center, middle

Package structure in python

`setup.py` as a Makefile

???

Most of it apply to all python packages

More repositories with smaller projects

---
name: packaging - package structure

## Package structure

Example with standard structure:

```bash
|- README.md
|- setup.py
|- setup.cfg
|- motor/
|    |- __init__.py
|    |- __main__.py
|    |- device.py
|    |- server.py
|- script/
|    |- Motor
|- test/
|    |- test_motor.py
|- docs/
|    |- source/
|    |     |- index.rst
|    |     |- conf.py
```

???

5 parts:

- setup for packaging

- package or packages 

- scripts to install

- unit tests

- documentation sources

***
---

#### `device.py` and `server.py`

Might interesting to:

- Split device and server in two modules

???

Helps to make the distinction

A matter of taste probably

***
--

- Get rid of the filename dependency to run the server:

  ```python
  from PyTango import server
  from motor.device import Motor

  SERVER_NAME = "Motor"

  def run(args=None, **kwargs):
      if not args:
          args = sys.argv[1:]
      args = [SERVER_NAME] + list(args)
      server.run((Motor,), args, **kwargs)
  
  if __name__ == "__main__":
      run()
  ```

???

Allows to run the server from anywhere

***
---

#### `__init__.py`

Make interesting objects visible at package level

```python
from motor.device import Motor
from motor.server import run
```

```python
>>> from motor import run
run(["instance_name"])
```

???

True for all python packages

Example: easily run the server from python interpreter

***
--

#### `__main__.py`

Take profit  of `-m` option

```python
from motor.server import run
run()
```

``` bash
$ python -m motor instance_name -v3
```

???

-m option: run the given library module as a script

`__main__.py` is called when running a package as a script

Won't work with python 2.6 and before

Example: easily run the server from the console 


***
---

#### `setup.py`

Metadata, packaging information and custom commands

```python
from setuptools import setup
from commands import UploadPages

setup(name="tangods-motor",
      version="0.1.0",
      description="Device server for a simple motor.",
      long_description=open("README.md").read(),
      packages=["motor"],
      scripts=["script/Motor"],
      test_suite="nose.collector",
      cmdclass={'upload_pages': UploadPages},
      )
```

#### `________`


See `distutils` and `setuptools` documentation for more information

???

`setup.py` includes:

- Metadata: name, version, descritpion

- Packaging: packages, script, test_suite

- Custom commands: here pusblish documentation on github pages 

***
---

#### `setup.cfg`

Add options for setup commands

```bash
[bdist_rpm]
requires = python-motorlib
build_requires = python-setuptools

[nosetests]
where = test
processes = 1 
process-restartworker = 1

[build_sphinx]
source-dir = docs/source
build-dir  = docs/build
```

#### `________`

See `distutils` and `setuptools` documentation for more information

???

Add options for:

- building rpm: dependencies

- unittesting: multiprocessing (cf first part)

- documentation: directories (cf second part)

***
---

## Usage

```bash
# Run server from package
$ python -m motor instance_name
# Install
$ python setup.py install
# Run server from script
$ Motor instance_name
# Tests
$ python setup.py nosetests
# Build docs 
$ python setup.py build_sphinx
# Upload documentation
$ python setup.py update_pages
# Build rpm
$ python setup.py bdist_rpm
```
